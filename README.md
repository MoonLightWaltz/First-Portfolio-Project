<h2>My first portfolio project</h2>
<br>
<p>This is my first attempt at a portfolio for myself that displays some of the projects I have worked on.</p>
<p>It is basic and the projects do on their do not have links as some of them are not uploaded on my github and are personal projects saved to my computer.</p>
<p>This is my latest project after completing freeCodeCamps responsive webdesign course.</p>
<p>You can find my socials and links on her as well in case you need to get in contact with me.</p>
<p>You can also view the website <a href="https://moonlightwaltz.github.io/First-Portfolio-Project/" target="_blank">here</a></p>
